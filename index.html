        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a 22-year-old cybersecurity IT student at Abu Dhabi University, with a passion for technology and problem-solving.<br> 
            I am particularly interested in the field of cybersecurity and its role in protecting digital assets and systems.<br> 
            My goal is to contribute to the development of secure software and networks, ensuring that they are resistant to cyber threats.<br> 
            I thrive in fast-paced environments and enjoy tackling complex challenges.<br> 
            My ability to think critically and adapt quickly has been honed through both my coursework and personal projects.<br> 
            Aside from my academic pursuits, I am also an avid billiards player, and I find socializing with others to be an important part of my personal development.<br> 
            I am always eager to expand my knowledge and skills and look forward to applying them in real-world settings.
